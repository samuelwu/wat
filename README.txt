My game is basically just a simple "reflex tester" game.
Push "Begin..." and then you'll have to wait for "GO!" to appear.
At that point, you have to press "Push!".  Then it'll measure how long it took you
between the appearance of GO! to when you pressed Push! (in milliseconds).
It also keeps track of your best score of multiple plays.  
Reset button has to be pushed before each play.

Just simply import into Eclipse on Windows and it should be runnable as an android project.
Have to use a virtual smart phone or a physical smart phone plugged in by USB.
